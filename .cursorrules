# Scaffold Monorepo

This monorepo contains three projects:

- **App**: A Vite + React application with React Router DOM, Tailwind, and ShadCN
- **Landing**: A Vite + React landing page using the same tech stack as the App
- **API**: A Bun + ExpressJS backend with Drizzle

## Tech Stack

- Bun
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI
- ExpressJS
- TypeORM

## Development

This project uses:

- Express.js for the web server
- Drizzle for database management
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Zod for validation
- Bun as the JavaScript runtime

## Key Points

- In case you need to add a shadcn component, instead of writing it yourself, use the shadcn command using bun to add it. And use `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add add`
